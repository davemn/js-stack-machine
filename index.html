         * The CPU in the original GameBoy is a modified Zilog Z80, so the following things are pertinent:
         * 
         * > The Z80 is an 8-bit chip, so all the internal workings operate on one byte at a time;
         * > The memory interface can address up to 65,536 bytes (a 16-bit address bus);
         * > Programs are accessed through the same address bus as normal memory;
         * > An instruction can be anywhere between one and three bytes.
         * 
         * In addition to the PC, other numbers are held inside the CPU that can be used for calculation, 
         * and they're referred to as registers: A, B, C, D, E, H, and L. Each of them is one byte, so 
         * each one can hold a value from 0 to 255. Most of the instructions in the Z80 are used to 
         * handle values in these registers: loading a value from memory into a register, adding or 
         * subtracting values, and so forth.
         * 
         * There are other registers in the Z80, that deal with holding status: the flags register (F), 
         * whose operation is discussed below; and the stack pointer (SP) which is used alongside the 
         * PUSH and POP instructions for basic LIFO handling of values.
         * 
         * The basic model of the Z80 emulation would therefore require the following components:
         * 
         * > An internal state:
         * > > A structure for retaining the current state of the registers;
         * > > The amount of time used to execute the last instruction;
         * > > The amount of time that the CPU has run in total;
         * > Functions to simulate each instruction;
         * > A table mapping said functions onto the opcode map;
         * > A known interface to talk to the simulated memory.
